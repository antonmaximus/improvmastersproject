**Description:**

An informational website built using modern front-end framework and uses various design techniques.

The site uses Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for its front-end framework.  Also, the site uses Google Docs as a backend in one of its pages.  The information from the Google Document is fetched via  jQuery and then delivered as JSON. In addition, the site follows a responsive design so that it accommodates various screen sizes.  

Furthermore, careful design analysis was incorporated in creating the site.  Orange which symbolizes energy and blue which symbolizes responsibility were chosen as the main colors as they represent the organization's mission.   A Modern Serif Font style was chosen for its typography heading since it depicts an arts & culture theme.  Finally, the logo created incorporates the fusion between the classic Improv type that uses the Broadway font and the traditional Toastmasters type that uses the Gotham font.

Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
